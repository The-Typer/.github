# TheTyper project description

TheTyper is a typing speed trainer project that consists of two repositories: TyperDesktop and TyperWord. TyperDesktop is a cross-platform desktop application written in Qt6, while TyperWord is a server application written in Go using the Gin framework.

The goal of the project is to provide users with a tool to improve their typing skills by practicing typing at different speeds. TyperDesktop provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to practice typing, while TyperWord handles the logic and data storage for the typing exercises.

To use TheTyper, both TyperDesktop and TyperWord must be running locally. TyperDesktop connects to TyperWord to retrieve typing exercises and submit results.

The screenshots below show the user interface of the TyperDesctop application.
